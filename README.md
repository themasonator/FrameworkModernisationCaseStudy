# .NET Framework Modernisation Case Study
A REST global exception handler and response wrapper for Web API written in Full .NET Framework, now modernised to .NET framework

This should serve as a case study for modernisation of .NET framework code to .NET, a task likely to become more common as .NET framework's support recedes.
In addition it should emulate a common situation of documentation no longer being available as the previous repo's documentation is now offline.
